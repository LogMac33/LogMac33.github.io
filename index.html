										<p>This plot, created using Python, visualizes the relationship between V&#775;CO<sub>2</sub> (carbon dioxide production) and FECO<sub>2</sub> (fractional expired CO2) over V&#775;O<sub>2</sub> (oxygen consumption). By examining these variables, the plot provides valuable insights into physiological thresholds and exercise intensities, which are crucial for understanding metabolic responses during physical activity.</p>

										<p>The plots were developed from a template code, which was customized to include multiple subplots for a comprehensive analysis. Additionally, specific thresholds were incorporated to highlight key points where significant changes in metabolic responses occur. These customizations enhance the clarity and utility of the visualizations, making them a powerful tool for both research and practical applications in sports science and health.</p>

										<p>Click "Learn More" to view my code on GitHub, where you can explore the detailed implementation and further customize the plots for your own needs.</p>

										<p>This Excel project involves creating a pivot table with interactive slicers from athlete data. The pivot table is a powerful tool for summarizing and analyzing large datasets, allowing you to quickly identify patterns and trends within the data. By using interactive slicers, you can easily filter and sort the data to focus on specific aspects, such as performance metrics, training sessions, or demographic information.</p>

										<p>The interactive nature of the sheet enhances its usability, making it highly effective for both detailed analysis and quick insights. You can explore the various buttons and slicers to see how they dynamically update the pivot table, providing a customized view of the data based on your selections. This functionality is particularly useful for coaches, analysts, and researchers who need to make data-driven decisions and track progress over time.</p>

										<p>Feel free to dive into the sheet and experiment with the interactive features to uncover valuable insights from the athlete data.</p>

									<p>This video analysis, created using Dartfish, provides a detailed breakdown of a golf swing, with various time points marked for tips and comments. Dartfish is a powerful tool for video analysis, allowing for precise examination of sport-specific movements. By marking key moments in the golf swing, this analysis highlights critical aspects of the technique, offering valuable insights for improvement.</p>

									<p>The marked time points include tips on posture, grip, swing path, and follow-through, making it easier to identify areas that need adjustment. This detailed feedback is particularly useful for athletes and coaches aiming to refine their technique and enhance performance. Additionally, the analysis can be used to monitor rehabilitation progress, ensuring that the athlete is recovering correctly and regaining proper form.</p>

									<p>By leveraging Dartfish's capabilities, this video analysis becomes an essential resource for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of golf mechanics and achieve better results on the course.</p>
